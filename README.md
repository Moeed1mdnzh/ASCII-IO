# ASCII-IO
Convert your images into ASCII characters by simply accomplishing double steps.
# Step 1
Head into command prompt or terminal.I assume that you already know how to
run your .py files from there by typing `python ASCII.py` but before that you have to parse a few arguments in cmd or terminal.We'll discuss this in step 2.
# Step 2
let's start with an example.
`python ASCII.py -p Desktop//python_files//image.jpg -n 3 -r 0.6 -s 20`
To understand the arguments you can simply type `python ASCII.py --help`
But don't worry, I feel the laziness too:)
