# ASCII-IO
Convert your images into ASCII characters by simply accomplishing double steps.
# Step 1
Head into command prompt or terminal.I assume that you already know how to
run your .py files from there by typing `python ASCII.py` but before that you have to parse a few arguments in cmd or terminal.We'll discuss this in step 2.
# Step 2
let's start with an example.
Take a look at this command
`python ASCII.py -p Desktop//python_files//image.jpg -n 3 -r 0.6 -s 20`
To understand the arguments you can simply type
the following command
`python ASCII.py --help`
But don't worry, I feel the laziness too:)
## IMPORTANT
You may check the code and notice that the variable ```Python
self.chars``` has sone unsupported characters.No need to worry about it because once you run the file in cmd or terminal you'll see them turn back into normal chars because they are supported there.
